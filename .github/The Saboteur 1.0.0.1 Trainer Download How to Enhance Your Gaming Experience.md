Aside from the main missions and the sabotage activities, The Saboteur also offers some optional side quests and challenges that can add more variety and fun to the gameplay. For example, you can participate in car races, rescue hostages, collect Nazi vehicles, or assassinate high-ranking officers. Completing these tasks can reward you with more contraband, perks, or unlockables such as new weapons, outfits, or vehicles.
 
The Saboteur also features a unique visual style that reflects the mood and atmosphere of the game. The areas under Nazi control are rendered in black and white, with only some splashes of color such as blood, fire, or the French flag. As you liberate these areas, color gradually returns to them, symbolizing the hope and resistance of the people. The game also has a great soundtrack that mixes authentic songs from the era with original compositions that suit the action and stealth sequences.
 
However, The Saboteur is not without its flaws. The game suffers from some technical issues such as bugs, glitches, crashes, or poor optimization. Some of these problems can be fixed by patches or mods, but others may require more patience or tolerance from the players. The game also has some design flaws such as repetitive dialogue, clichÃƒÂ©d characters, unrealistic physics, or lack of depth in some gameplay elements. The game may not appeal to everyone's taste or expectations, especially those who are looking for a more realistic or challenging experience.
 
Overall, The Saboteur is a game that has a lot of potential and charm, but also some noticeable shortcomings. It is a game that can be enjoyed for its fun and engaging gameplay, its intriguing and original setting, and its stylish and atmospheric presentation. It is a game that can be forgiven for its flaws if you are willing to overlook them and focus on its strengths. It is a game that deserves a chance to be played and appreciated by fans of open-world action-adventure games.
