Guilty Crown is a 2011 anime series produced by Production I.G and aired on Fuji TV's noitamina block. The series is set in a futuristic Japan that has been ravaged by a mysterious virus called the Apocalypse Virus, which caused a cataclysmic event known as the Lost Christmas in 2029. The country is now under the control of a foreign organization called the GHQ, which imposes strict martial law and suppresses any resistance. The story follows Shu Ouma, a timid high school student who acquires a special power called the Power of the King, which allows him to extract weapons called Voids from the hearts of other people. He joins a rebel group called Funeral Parlor, led by the charismatic Gai Tsutsugami, who aims to overthrow the GHQ and restore Japan's independence.
 
Guilty Crown is a thrilling anime that combines action, drama, sci-fi, and romance elements. The series explores themes such as identity, freedom, responsibility, and sacrifice. The animation is stunning, with fluid and dynamic fight scenes and detailed backgrounds. The music is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, who creates an epic and emotional soundtrack that enhances the mood and atmosphere of the show. The voice acting is also superb, with Yuki Kaji as Shu, Ai Kayano as Inori, Kana Hanazawa as Ayase, and Patrick Seitz as Gai in the Japanese and English versions respectively.
