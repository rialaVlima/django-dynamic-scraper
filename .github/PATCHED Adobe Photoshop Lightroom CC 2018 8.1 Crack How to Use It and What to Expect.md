## Step 1: Import and Organize Your Photos
 
The first step to edit photos like a pro with Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC 2018 8.1 is to import and organize your photos. You can import photos from your computer, camera, or mobile device using the Import button on the bottom left corner of the Library module. You can also drag and drop folders or files into the Lightroom window.
 
Once you have imported your photos, you can organize them using collections, keywords, ratings, flags, and labels. Collections are virtual albums that let you group photos by theme, project, or any criteria you choose. Keywords are descriptive words that help you find and filter your photos later. Ratings are stars that indicate how much you like a photo, from one to five. Flags are markers that show whether a photo is a pick, a reject, or unflagged. Labels are colors that you can assign to photos for quick identification.
 
To create a collection, click on the + icon next to Collections on the left panel and choose Create Collection. Give it a name and select the photos you want to include. To add keywords to your photos, select them and type in the Keywording panel on the right. To rate your photos, select them and press 1-5 on your keyboard or click on the stars below the thumbnails. To flag your photos, select them and press P for pick, X for reject, or U for unflagged. To label your photos, select them and press 6-9 on your keyboard or right-click on them and choose Set Color Label.
 
## Step 2: Select and Rate Your Best Shots
 
The next step to edit photos like a pro with Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC 2018 8.1 is to select and rate your best shots. This will help you narrow down your choices and focus on the photos that matter most.
 
One way to do this is to use the Compare view in the Library module. This allows you to compare two photos side by side and choose the better one. To enter Compare view, select two photos and press C on your keyboard or click on the XY icon on the toolbar below the preview window. You can use the arrow keys or the buttons on the toolbar to switch between photos. You can also zoom in and out using the slider or the mouse wheel.
