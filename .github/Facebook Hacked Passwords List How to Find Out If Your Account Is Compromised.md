# How to Protect Your Facebook Account from Hackers
 
Facebook is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world, with over 2.8 billion monthly active users. However, this also makes it a prime target for hackers who want to steal your personal information, access your contacts, or even take over your account. In fact, according to a report by Comparitech, over 300 million Facebook accounts have been exposed in data breaches since 2018.
 
If you don't want to be one of them, you need to take some steps to secure your Facebook account and prevent hackers from getting your password. In this article, we'll show you how to do that and what to do if you think your account has been hacked.

## How to Secure Your Facebook Account
 
The first thing you should do is to create a strong and unique password for your Facebook account. A strong password is one that is at least 8 characters long, contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and is not easy to guess or crack. A unique password is one that you don't use for any other online account or service.
 
You can use a password manager like LastPass or 1Password to generate and store strong passwords for you. Alternatively, you can use a passphrase, which is a sentence or phrase that you can remember easily but is hard for others to guess. For example, "I love chocolate cake with strawberries" or "My favorite movie is The Godfather".
 
Once you have a strong password, you should change it regularly, at least every few months. You can do this by going to Settings > Security and Login > Change Password on Facebook.
 
Another way to protect your Facebook account is to enable two-factor authentication (2FA). This is a feature that adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to enter a code or use an app on your phone whenever you log in from a new device or browser. This way, even if someone gets your password, they won't be able to access your account without your phone.

You can enable 2FA by going to Settings > Security and Login > Two-Factor Authentication on Facebook. You can choose between text message (SMS) codes or authentication apps like Google Authenticator or Authy. We recommend using an app as it is more secure and reliable than SMS codes.
 
## How to Recover Your Facebook Account if It Has Been Hacked
 
If you notice any suspicious activity on your Facebook account, such as posts or messages that you didn't create, changes to your name or birthday, friend requests that you didn't send, or login alerts from unknown devices or locations, you should act quickly to regain control of your account and prevent further damage.
 
Here are the steps you should follow if you think your Facebook account has been hacked:
 
1. Go to [https://www.facebook.com/hacked](https://www.facebook.com/hacked) and click on "My Account Is Compromised".
2. Enter your email address or phone number associated with your account and click on "Search".
3. Enter your current or old password and click on "Continue".
4. Facebook will ask you to change your password and review recent login activity. Follow the instructions on the screen and secure your account.
5. If you can't access your account because the hacker changed your email or phone number, click on "No longer have access to these?" and try to recover your account using another email address or phone number that you have added to your account.
6. If none of these options work, click on "I can't access my email account" and fill out the form with as much information as possible. Facebook will review your request and get back to you within 24 hours.

After you recover your account, you should also check your privacy settings, app permissions, payment methods, and other information that may have been changed by the hacker. You should also notify your friends and contacts that your account was hacked and ask them to ignore any suspicious messages or requests from you.
