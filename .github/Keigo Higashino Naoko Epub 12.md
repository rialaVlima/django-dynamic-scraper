Naoko is a novel by Keigo Higashino, a Japanese author known for his mystery and thriller novels. The book was first published in Japan in 1998 and translated into English by Kerim Yasar in 2004[^1^]. Naoko is a story of a family that undergoes a bizarre transformation after a tragic bus accident. Naoko, the mother, dies in the crash, but her consciousness somehow transfers into her daughter Monami, who survives with brain damage. Monami wakes up with Naoko's memories and personality, while her own identity is buried deep inside. The father, Heisuke, is shocked and confused by this phenomenon, but decides to keep it a secret and live with his "new" wife and daughter. However, as time goes by, he faces many challenges and dilemmas as he tries to cope with this surreal situation.
