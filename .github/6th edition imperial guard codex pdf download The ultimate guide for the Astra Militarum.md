In this article, we will also give you some tips on how to play with the Imperial Guard army in Warhammer 40,000. The Imperial Guard is one of the most numerous and diverse factions in the game, representing the human soldiers of the Imperium of Man. They are known for their massed infantry, heavy artillery, and armored vehicles.
 
Some of the advantages of playing with the Imperial Guard are:

- You have a lot of options and flexibility to customize your army list and tactics. You can choose from different regiments, doctrines, orders, stratagems, and relics to suit your playstyle and preferences.
- You have access to some of the most powerful and versatile units and weapons in the game, such as the Leman Russ battle tank, the Basilisk artillery, the Baneblade super-heavy tank, and the Manticore missile launcher.
- You can overwhelm your enemies with sheer numbers and firepower. You can field hundreds of infantry models and dozens of vehicles in a single army, creating a formidable force that can hold objectives and deal damage.

Some of the challenges of playing with the Imperial Guard are:

- You have to deal with low morale and leadership. Your infantry units are often fragile and vulnerable to enemy attacks, and they can easily flee or break under pressure. You have to use your officers and commissars to keep them in line and inspire them.
- You have to manage your resources and logistics. Your army can be expensive to buy and paint, both in terms of money and time. You also have to transport and store your models safely and efficiently.
- You have to balance your offense and defense. Your army can dish out a lot of damage, but it can also take a lot of damage. You have to protect your valuable units and assets from enemy threats and counterattacks.

Some of the general tips on how to play with the Imperial Guard are:

- Use your orders wisely. Orders are special commands that you can give to your infantry units once per turn, allowing them to perform extra actions or gain bonuses. For example, you can order them to move faster, shoot more accurately, or fight harder in close combat.
- Use your stratagems effectively. Stratagems are special abilities that you can use once per battle round, spending command points that you generate from your army list. For example, you can use them to reroll dice, boost your units' performance, or disrupt your enemy's plans.
- Use your synergies efficiently. Synergies are combinations of units, abilities, and effects that work well together and enhance each other's strengths. For example, you can use your psykers to buff your units or debuff your enemies, use your artillery to support your infantry or vehicles, or use your flyers to harass or flank your opponents.
