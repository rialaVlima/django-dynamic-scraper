2Pac, also known as Tupac Shakur, was one of the most influential and controversial rap artists of all time. His 1996 album *All Eyez On Me* was his fourth studio album and the last one released before his death. It is widely regarded as a masterpiece of West Coast hip hop, gangsta rap, and G-funk genres. The album features guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Method Man, Redman, and many others. It also contains some of 2Pac's most famous songs, such as "California Love", "How Do U Want It", "I Ain't Mad At Cha", and "2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted".
 
The album was originally released as a double CD with 27 tracks, but some fans have been looking for the original version of the album that 2Pac recorded before it was remastered and edited by Death Row Records. This version is known as the OG (original gangsta) album and it contains some differences from the official release, such as alternate lyrics, beats, mixes, and song titles. For example, the OG version of "Ambitionz Az A Ridah" has a different intro and outro, the OG version of "All About U" has a different chorus and verse from 2Pac, and the OG version of "Heaven Ain't Hard 2 Find" has a different beat and hook.
