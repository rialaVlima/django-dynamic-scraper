## Preparation for the Prayer
 
Before performing Mayyith Niskaram, the following steps should be taken:
 
- The body of the deceased should be washed (ghusl) and shrouded (kafan) according to the Islamic rules.
- The body should be placed on a bier or a stretcher, with the head facing the qibla (direction of Mecca).
- The body should be transported to a mosque or a suitable place for the prayer.
- The person leading the prayer (imam) should stand in front of the body, facing the qibla. The other participants should stand behind him in rows.

## Performance of the Prayer
 
The Mayyith Niskaram consists of four takbirs (saying "Allahu akbar"), followed by supplications (dua) for the deceased. There is no ruku (bowing) or sujud (prostration) in this prayer. The prayer is performed as follows:

1. The imam says the first takbir and raises his hands up to his ears. The participants follow him.
2. The imam recites Surah Al-Fatiha (the opening chapter of the Quran) silently. The participants listen to him.
3. The imam says the second takbir and raises his hands up to his ears. The participants follow him.
4. The imam recites Surah Al-Ikhlas (the chapter of sincerity) silently. The participants listen to him.
5. The imam says the third takbir and raises his hands up to his ears. The participants follow him.
6. The imam recites a dua for the deceased, such as: *"Allahumma ighfir lihayyina wa mayyitina wa shahidina wa gha'ibina wa saghirina wa kabirina wa dhakarina wa unthana. Allahumma man ahyaytahu minna fa ahyihi 'ala al-Islam wa man tawaffaytahu minna fa tawaffahu 'ala al-iman."* (O Allah, forgive our living and our dead, our present and our absent, our young and our old, our male and our female. O Allah, whoever You keep alive among us, keep him alive on Islam, and whoever You cause to die among us, cause him to die on faith.) The participants say *"Ameen"* after him.
7. The imam says the fourth takbir and raises his hands up to his ears. The participants follow him.
8. The imam recites another dua for the deceased, such as: *"Allahumma la tahrimna ajrahu wa la taftinna ba'dahu wa ghfir lana wa lahu."* (O Allah, do not deprive us of his reward, and do not afflict us after him, and forgive us and him.) The participants say *"Ameen"* after him.
9. The imam says *"Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullah"* (Peace and mercy of Allah be upon you) while turning his head to the right. The participants follow him.
10. The imam says *"Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullah"* while turning his head to the left. The participants follow him.

The Mayyith Niskaram is completed with these steps. The body of the deceased is then taken to the graveyard for burial.
