If you want to develop Java applications, applets, and components using the Java programming language, you need to install the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) on your computer. The JDK includes tools such as the Java compiler, debugger, and runtime environment. In this article, we will show you how to download and install JDK 1.6 on Windows 7 64 bit.
 
## Step 1: Download JDK 1.6
 
The first step is to download the JDK 1.6 installer from the Oracle website. You can find the archive downloads for Java SE 7 here[^1^]. Scroll down to the section "Java SE Development Kit 7u80" and click on the link for "Windows x64". This will take you to a sign-in page where you need to enter your Oracle account credentials or create a new one for free.

Alternatively, you can use this direct link[^2^] to download the jdk-7u80-windows-x64.exe file. This is the same file that is available on the Oracle website, but it does not require signing in.
 
## Step 2: Install JDK 1.6
 
Once you have downloaded the JDK 1.6 installer, double-click on it to launch it. You will see a welcome screen that asks you to choose the installation directory. The default location is C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0\_80. You can change it if you want, but make sure you have enough space on your hard drive.
 
Click Next and follow the instructions on the screen. The installer will copy the files and create some registry entries. It will also ask you if you want to install the public JRE (Java Runtime Environment) along with the JDK. The JRE is required to run Java applications on your computer. You can choose to install it or not, depending on your needs.
 
When the installation is complete, click Finish to exit the installer.
 
## Step 3: Set JAVA\_HOME and PATH environment variables
 
The final step is to set some environment variables that will help your computer recognize where the JDK is installed and how to use it. To do this, follow these steps:

- Open Control Panel and click on System and Security.
- Click on System and then click on Advanced system settings.
- Click on Environment Variables at the bottom of the window.
- In the System variables section, click on New.
- Type JAVA\_HOME in the Variable name field and C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0\_80 (or your installation directory) in the Variable value field.
- Click OK to create the variable.
- In the same section, find the variable named PATH and click on Edit.
- Add %JAVA\_HOME%\bin at the end of the Variable value field, separated by a semicolon (;) from the previous value.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed JDK 1.6 on Windows 7 64 bit. To verify that it works, open a command prompt and type javac -version. You should see something like this:

    C:\Users\user>javac -version
    javac 1.6.0_80

This means that you can use the Java compiler to create Java programs. You can also use other tools that are included in the JDK, such as the debugger (jdb), the documentation generator (javadoc), and the archive tool (jar).
 
## Conclusion
 
In this article, we have shown you how to download and install JDK 1.6 on Windows 7 64 bit. We have also explained how to set some environment variables that will make it easier for you to use the JDK tools.
