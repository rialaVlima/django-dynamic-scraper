# Bulsatcom Keys for Irdeto 2 Cracked
 
Bulsatcom is the largest provider of pay TV in Bulgaria, offering satellite and interactive TV with over 240 channels, including 130 in HD and 8 in UHD format[^2^]. However, some users have found a way to crack the encryption system used by Bulsatcom, known as Irdeto 2[^3^]. Irdeto 2 is a digital platform cybersecurity solution developed by Irdeto, a company that claims to protect revenue, enable growth and fight cybercrime for various industries[^3^]. By using softcam keys, which are software versions of smart cards that contain the decryption keys, users can access Bulsatcom's channels without paying for a subscription[^1^]. This article will explain how to find and use these softcam keys for Irdeto 2.
 
The first step is to download a softcam key file that contains the latest keys for Bulsatcom's Irdeto 2 encryption. One possible source is the Linux Satellite Support forum, where users share and update softcam key files for various satellite providers[^1^]. The file name should have the format Softcam.Bulsatcom.<date>.key.zip, where <date> is the date of the last update. For example, Softcam.Bulsatcom.10.11.2020.key.zip was posted on November 10th, 2020[^1^]. You can download the file from the link provided in the forum post.</date></date>

The second step is to unzip the softcam key file and copy it to your satellite receiver's device. The exact location and method of copying may vary depending on your receiver model and software, but usually you need to connect your receiver to your computer via USB or network cable and use a file manager program to transfer the file. The file should be placed in a folder named Keys or Softcam inside your receiver's directory. You may need to rename the file to match your receiver's format, such as SoftCam.Key or Key.bin.

The third step is to restart your receiver and scan for Bulsatcom's channels. You should be able to view them without any problems, as long as the keys in the softcam key file are valid and up-to-date. However, keep in mind that Bulsatcom may change their keys at any time to prevent unauthorized access, so you may need to repeat this process with a new softcam key file periodically. Also, be aware that cracking Bulsatcom's encryption is illegal and may result in legal consequences or service termination.

In this article, we have explained how to crack Bulsatcom's Irdeto 2 encryption using softcam keys. However, we do not recommend or endorse this practice, as it is unethical and illegal. Bulsatcom is a legitimate company that provides quality TV service to its customers, and cracking their encryption is a form of theft and piracy. Moreover, cracking Bulsatcom's encryption may expose you to security risks, such as malware, viruses, or hackers. Therefore, we advise you to respect Bulsatcom's rights and pay for their service if you want to enjoy their channels.

How does Bulsatcom's Irdeto 2 encryption work? Irdeto 2 is a conditional access system (CAS) that uses smart cards to control the access to Bulsatcom's channels. Each smart card contains a unique identification number and a secret key that are used to decrypt the signals sent by Bulsatcom's satellites. The smart card communicates with the receiver via a card reader and verifies that the user has a valid subscription for the requested channel. If the verification is successful, the smart card sends the decryption key to the receiver, which then decodes the signal and displays the channel on the TV screen. If the verification fails, the smart card denies the access and the receiver shows an error message or a black screen.
 
How do softcam keys crack Bulsatcom's Irdeto 2 encryption? Softcam keys are software versions of smart cards that emulate their functionality. They contain the same identification numbers and secret keys as the original smart cards, but they are stored in a file instead of a physical card. By using softcam keys, users can bypass the need for a card reader and a valid subscription, and trick the receiver into thinking that they have a legitimate smart card. The receiver then accepts the softcam keys as valid and decrypts Bulsatcom's channels without any authorization.
 
How do users obtain softcam keys for Bulsatcom's Irdeto 2 encryption? Softcam keys are usually obtained by hacking or reverse engineering Bulsatcom's smart cards. Hackers use various methods to extract the identification numbers and secret keys from the smart cards, such as physical tampering, electronic probing, or software analysis. They then share these keys online in forums, websites, or social media platforms, where other users can download them and use them for their own receivers. However, this process is not easy or risk-free, as Bulsatcom constantly updates their encryption system and changes their keys to prevent hacking and cracking.
