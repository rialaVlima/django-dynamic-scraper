## Step 2: Add Photos to the Workspace
 
Once you have installed Agisoft PhotoScan Professional 1.4.3 Build 6529, you can launch it and start a new project. To add photos to the workspace, you can either drag and drop them from your file explorer or use the Add Photos button on the toolbar. You can also create folders and subfolders to organize your photos in the workspace.
 
It is recommended that you use high-quality photos with good lighting and sharpness, and avoid blurry, dark, or distorted images. You should also make sure that the object you want to model is well visible and covered from different angles and distances in the photos.
 
## Step 3: Align Photos
 
The next step is to align the photos and generate a sparse point cloud that represents the shape and position of the object in 3D space. To do this, you need to select all the photos in the workspace and click on the Align Photos button on the toolbar. You can also adjust some parameters before running the alignment, such as accuracy, key point limit, tie point limit, etc.

The alignment process may take some time depending on the number and size of your photos and the performance of your computer. When it is done, you will see a sparse point cloud in the Model view and a set of camera positions in the Photos view.
 
## Step 4: Build Dense Point Cloud
 
The next step is to build a dense point cloud that adds more details and accuracy to the sparse point cloud. To do this, you need to select all the photos in the workspace and click on the Build Dense Cloud button on the toolbar. You can also adjust some parameters before running the dense cloud generation, such as quality, depth filtering, etc.
 
The dense cloud generation process may take longer than the alignment process depending on your settings and hardware. When it is done, you will see a dense point cloud in the Model view that looks more realistic and detailed than the sparse one.
 
## Step 5: Build Mesh
 
The next step is to build a mesh that converts the dense point cloud into a polygonal surface that can be textured and exported as a 3D model. To do this, you need to select all the photos in the workspace and click on the Build Mesh button on the toolbar. You can also adjust some parameters before running the mesh generation, such as surface type, source data, face count, interpolation, etc.
 
The mesh generation process may also take some time depending on your settings and hardware. When it is done, you will see a mesh in the Model view that looks like a solid object with smooth edges and curves.
 
## Step 6: Build Texture
 
The final step is to build a texture that applies colors and details from the photos to the mesh surface. To do this, you need to select all the photos in the workspace and click on the Build Texture button on the toolbar. You can also adjust some parameters before running the texture generation, such as mapping mode, blending mode, texture size, texture count, etc.
 
The texture generation process may be faster than the previous
